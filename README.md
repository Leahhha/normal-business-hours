# Normal Business Hours
*Part of an assignment for the ReCode class at NYU's IMA program, Fall 2023.*

## Project Description
Starter code for a website that serves your resume only during your normal business hours. Otherwise, it returns a simple message explaining when potential employers can return to find the information they seek.

## Working Process:

For this assignment, I collected lots of useful references for creating cool html and css with fun animation.

I set the working hours to Every 9am to 5pm.

### Coding Part:

This is my favorite coding part by add hover state to navigation

Also the texts pops up smoothly by utilizing the greensock external library

I love the overall outcome, and I wish to add scroll function with 3-4 image background to make the page more interactive.

Sadly, after several attemps I wasn't able to combine that on my page.

Probably, look into the div element more, haven't figured out yet.
